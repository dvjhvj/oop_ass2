  <b>Subject:</b> Object - Oriented Programming
</p>

## üìñ Overview  
This repository provides a collection of simple C++ programs designed to practice the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
Each example demonstrates how to define classes, create objects, and implement basic methods in C++.  

The exercises cover real-world entities such as cars, students, books, employees, and more.  
They are intended for beginners who want to strengthen their understanding of classes and objects in C++.  

By following these examples, you will learn how to:
- Define classes with attributes and methods.  
- Create and use objects in C++.  
- Apply OOP principles in small, practical programs. 
 
## üöÄ How to Run Code

In Visual Studio Code (VSC), you can run your code in **3 ways**:

1. **Run Code button**  
   - Click the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button (triangle) in the top-right corner.  
   - Select **"Run Code"** ‚Üí your code will be compiled and the result printed to the screen.  

2. **Shortcut key**  
   - Use the shortcut: `Ctrl + Alt + N` (same effect as the first way).  

3. **Run via Terminal**  
   - **Step 1:** On the toolbar, open **Terminal ‚Üí New Terminal**.  
   - **Step 2:** Compile your code with:
     ```bash
     g++ fileName.cpp -o fileName
     ```
     This command generates an `.exe` file.
   - **Step 3:** Run the program:
     ```bash
     ./fileName
     ```
   - **Note:**  
     - `fileName.cpp` = the name of your C++ file.  
     - `fileName` = the name of the executable (you can choose another name, but usually keep it the same as your source file for clarity).
    
## ü§ñ About the using AI in learning and doing process  

The AI tool I used most frequently is **ChatGPT**. In this assignment, AI mainly supported me in **English writing** rather than coding.  

- **Advantages:**  
  - These exercises are fundamental, so it was straightforward to write the code myself according to each requirement.  
  - I had already practiced using Markdown in a previous semester, which made it easier to format this README file.  

- **Challenges and how I addressed them:**  
  - **Variable naming in English:** sometimes I had no ideas for meaningful names ‚Üí AI provided suggestions.  
  - **English writing in Notes and the README file:**  
    - Sometimes I first wrote in Vietnamese and then asked AI to translate it into English (applied in Section 3).  
    - Other times I drafted the content in English based on my vocabulary and ideas, then asked AI to shorten and refine it (applied in Section 2).  
  - **Markdown formatting:** I outlined the structure I wanted, then asked AI to generate a proper layout (applied in the introduction section).
